## File structure
This repository contains codes for OAE(optical aberration estimation).

`/model` contains the optical aberration model.

`/dataset` includes datasets used for training the optical aberration model.

`/sfrmat5_dist` contains the SFR calculation algorithm, which was downloaded from [ISO 12233](https://www.imaging.org/site/IST/Standards/Digital_Camera_Resolution_Tools/IST/Standards/Digital_Camera_Resolution_Tools.aspx#msw.).

`/results` stores the results, including the PSF map and PSF comparisons.

## SFR Data Preparation

Follow these steps to generate the necessary SFR (Spatial Frequency Response) data for training.

1.  **Generate Blurry Edges:**
    Run the Python script `generate_edges_rgb.py` to process your images and obtain the initial blurry edge data.
    ```bash
    python generate_edges_rgb.py
    ```

2.  **Calculate SFR Curves:**
    Next, open MATLAB and execute the `user_sfrmat5_rgb.m` script. This will analyze the edges from the previous step to compute and save the SFR curves.

3.  **Generate Training Data:**
    Finally, run the `generate_fov_weight.py` script. This will process the SFR curves and generate the final `.npz` files that will be used as input for the training process.
    ```bash
    python generate_fov_weight.py
    ```

## Training
To train an aberration learning model from scratch, run `main.py`. The results will be saved in /results/lensname.

## Q & A
**1. Why is F=5 used as the scaling factor (see scale in optics_rgb.py)?‚Äã‚Äã**  
<small>When extracting a 2D MTF slice from the 3D MTF data (as implemented in slice within tool.py), we intentionally scale the coordinate system by a factor of 5.  
This expansion:  
   - Reduces quantization errors during interpolation  
   - Improves numerical precision in the slicing operation  
The scaling factor (F=5) is subsequently applied to compensate for this coordinate expansion, ensuring the final results maintain their proper scale and accuracy.</small>
